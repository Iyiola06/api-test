Every action provides immediate visual feedback through colors, animations, and notifications.

### 4. Developer-Focused
Designed specifically for technical users who value efficiency and power features.

### 5. Consistency
Patterns are maintained across all screens. Learn once, use everywhere.

  editData,         // PUT requests
  deleteData,       // DELETE requests
  loginUser,        // Authentication

  showToast,        // Already implemented!
  // ... and more
} from '../controllers/controllers.js';
```
